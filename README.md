# Udacity_WeRateDogs_Project2
 Udacity Data Wrangling Project

This Project is meant to help the student refine their data cleaning skill, by identifying cleanliness and tidiness issues as well as combining data from multiple sources and in varying formats.

The varied datasets typically have one column in common which allows us to merge them into one big encompassing dataset which contains a lot more data that we could draw insights from.
